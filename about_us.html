			Basically our interface is appropriate for the websites which are based on teacher and student incognito interaction. To say in simpler words it is appropriate for a website which lets any member teacher to upload a test under a specific genre and course code so that any member student can attempt it. Moreover the identity of teacher and student for the website will be just one registration number which will be generated by the interface on the time of registration so that their original identities can remain incognito or in other words their presence on our interface must remain anonymous.<br><br>So our main notion of making this interface incognito is solely backed by the psychological facts. The facts I have just mentioned are not so unknown in such advanced era as this but we ignorant and selfish people are the ones who try to push the constraints of the mental abilities of the children by comparing their grades with other children, pushing them in the “rat-race” without realising that we unknowingly are hurting the feelings of our very own children.
So we as a team brainstormed on this serious issue and came to a conclusion that the best way to prevent this disaster is to limit the information that reaches the parents, children or even the teachers. This is to avoid the culture of inferiority complex among children and can strive towards perfection with their heads held high.<br><br>So what this basically do is give the children an environment where they can test their abilities in private without the fear being judged by anyone and can know their weaknesses and strengths, so that work upon their present weaknesses and can turn them into their strengths.
